● How is memory managed in C++ ?
Each program has a stack, heap and static memory areas. Stack is needed when objects are created directly inside of functions, stack is relatively small (8mb standard size). Everything created with a "new" operator goes to heap, heap is a large storage. And the static area contains static variables.

● What is polymorphism ? Types of polymorphism ?
Polymorphism is the ability of an object to have different behaviour in different situations.
Compile time polymorphism is created by functions overloading, runtime polymorphism is created by virtual functions.

● What is a friend function ?
A friend function is a function declared outside of a class, but is able to access private fields of this class.

● What is multithreading ?
Multithreading is execution of program more than in a single execution thread.

● How can one optimise an C++ program ?
Run program with performance evaluation and find weak spots (function calls which take significant amount of time, or called too often)
Review data structures, avoid excess data, avoid unnecessary data copiyng. Make data ownership clear (using unique_ptr).
Review algorithms - make them more optimized (example O(n ^ 2) remake with O(n log n) algorithm). 
Review network interactions - review data and frequency of network messages.
Move heavy logic to separate threads if possible.

● What is the diamond problem ?
Diamond is a situation where we have the following inheritance case (or more complex but with the same idea)
     A
	/ \
   B   C 
    \ /
	 D
	 
In this situation with simple inheritance when we create object D we would have two copies of data of A class. It may be resolved by virtual inheritance.
